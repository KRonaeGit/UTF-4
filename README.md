# UTF-4
UTF-4 is a NEW 1~3 byte variable length encoding!

## Why UTF-4?
UTF-8, which we mainly use and is an international standard, is a variable length method of 1~4 bytes. (Maximum 4 bytes)
But in fact, 3 bytes is enough to express all the characters of Unicode.
> So UTF-4 can implement **more characters in a smaller size than UTF-8!**
